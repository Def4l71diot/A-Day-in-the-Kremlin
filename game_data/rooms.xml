        <name>Stalin's Reception</name>
        <description>
This is Stalin's reception. There's no one in here. There's just one matryoshka doll standing on the desk that's probably left
here just to serve as a receptionist. In fact, Stalin doesn't really need a reception, no one's ever visiting him...
An elephant-sized cage is present. It's open and probably something has escaped from it.

You are in the toilet which has been heavily decorated in Stalin's favourite colour 'Flamingo Pink'.
The dim light and horrendous smell already makes you feel like you've walked into a sewer, only it's stuffy and warm.
A portrait of his beloved mother hangs above the sink... Christ she looks just like him.
A gold plated toilet sits in the far corner which Stalin calls his 'Throne' and no wonder why!
The horrible smell is obviously coming from under the seat... your only hope is to plead that Stalin has had a light lunch.
You approach without heaving... Doesn't this man know how to flush?!

A cavernous room with high vaulted ceiling, the walls are filled with portraits of great Russian leaders, though you only
seem to see photos of Stalin.

This seething mass of people is the kitchen, people are running back and forth with huge looming chefs barking orders.
You eye suspiciously the red stains on the floor, it would be wise to watch your step.

        <description>
As you look around the eastern gardens you notice a sea of golden statues or the great leaders of this age. You soon realise
they are all statues of Stalin. Around the edge of the garden there are trimmed hedges.
You are standing on the marble pathway leading to a fountain in the centre of the gardens. Out of the fountain, an everlasting
stream of Vodka emerges. A great oak tree stands in the right-hand corner of the eastern gardens, under which Kirillina the Bear
rides her tri-cycle round and round the trunk of the tree. She appears to be having the time of her life and any sign of disturbance
would send her into a raging frenzy.

        <description>
The Western Gardens are very similar to the Eastern Gardens but if you look closer at the statues and hedges
you will notice the much a darker appeal of these gardens, it would not be wise to dwell on if that statue looks like your cousin.

You have arrived in the nearest Tesco Express.
You make your way to the Meal Deal isle; where many combinations of Mains,
Snacks and Drinks lay in front of you. Let's hope that Stalin will like it.

You go down the stairs to the basement level of the Kremlin, the air is dark and musky, are you sure you want to be here?
