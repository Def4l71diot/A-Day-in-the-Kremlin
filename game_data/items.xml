        <name>a manky toilet brush</name>
        <description>You find a toilet brush that looks like it's from the roman times. Only Thor himself could scrub hard enough to clean anything with this - It is no more than a stick and sponge that keeps falling off. Ew! The stick end has been sharpened down and has a faded red colour to it... Hmm</description>

        <name>Kirillina's collar</name>
        <description>This huge studded collar initially appears to be better suited a rhino, than a pet. As you look closer you notice the small pink flowers engrained into the fabric of the collar, as well as the name, 'Kirillina'.</description>
